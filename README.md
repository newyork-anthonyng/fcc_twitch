## TwitchTV
This is the last intermediate front-end project for freecodecamp.com. I am creating a website that let's you see which Twitch streamers are online.

## Not yet hosted

## Tools Used
jQuery, HTML and SASS/CSS, Express and Node

## User Stories
  * I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv
  * I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel
  * If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming
  * I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account
